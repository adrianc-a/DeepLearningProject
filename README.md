# Playing games with AlphaGo Zero techniques

## To install the dependencies
Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## To run
Run `python3 src/main.py`
Of course, you must edit main to play the game you want to play.

## Generating the report
Once in the report directory, you can run `make` to generate a pdf and also open it,
if you're using iTerm. Otherwise, you can just run `make generate` to generate
the pdf without opening it.
