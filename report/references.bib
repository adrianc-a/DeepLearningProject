abstract="In this paper we present TDLEAF($\lambda$), a variation on the TD($\lambda$) algorithm that enables it to be used in conjunction with game-tree search. We present some experiments in which our chess program ``KnightCap'' used TDLEAF($\lambda$) to learn its evaluation function while playing on Internet chess servers. The main success we report is that KnightCap improved from a 1650 rating to a 2150 rating in just 308 games and 3 days of play. As a reference, a rating of 1650 corresponds to about level B human play (on a scale from E (1000) to A (1800)), while 2150 is human master level. We discuss some of the reasons for this success, principle among them being the use of on-line, rather than self-play. We also investigate whether TDLEAF($\lambda$) can yield better results in the domain of backgammon, where TD($\lambda$) has previously yielded striking success.",
